# Peace Corps Hub

### Background

Systers has partnered with Peace Corps to develop several web and mobile applications. We've also created a Mobile App Control Center (MACC) to push notifications and updates from web application to mobile app. All of the applications have separate repos in our Github organization, but we don't have a central hub for Peace Corps staff and volunteers to access all of the applications. The next phase in bringing all of the applications together is the Peace Corps Hub.

### Installation Guide

#### 1. Installing Ruby

There are several options to install Ruby, this tutorial will use the installation from source, but you can see tutorials of others options on the [Ruby page](https://www.ruby-lang.org/pt/documentation/installation/).

To install from source download and unpack [this package](https://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/2.3/ruby-2.3.1.tar.gz).
Then do:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

By default, this will install Ruby into `/usr/local`. To change, pass the `--prefix=DIR` option to the `./configure` script.

#### 2. Installing SQLite

Today, almost all the flavours of Linux OS and latest version of Mac OS X are being shipped with SQLite. So you just issue the following command to check if you already have SQLite installed on your machine or not.

    $ sqlite3 --version

If you don't have SQLite installed, follow the steps below:

Download [this package](http://www.sqlite.org/2016/sqlite-autoconf-3150000.tar.gz).

Then do:

    $ tar xvfz sqlite-autoconf-3071502.tar.gz
    $ cd sqlite-autoconf-3071502
    $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
    $ make
    $ make install

#### 3. Installing Rails

To install Rails, use the gem install command provided by RubyGems:

    $ gem install rails

To verify that you have everything installed correctly, you should be able to run the following:

    $ rails --version

#### 4. Installing Dependencies

ImageMagick is a dependency for this project. If you don't have it installed, install it by following the steps here:

[https://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/download.php)

#### 5. Setting environment variables

Set environment variables such as account settings and API keys in pc-hub/config/local_env.yml. The file is gitignored, so
private information will not be checked in.

### Running the App

Download or clone the app to your desktop.
cd into the pchub/pc-hub directory:

    $ cd path_to_downloaded_pchub_repo/pc-hub

Install the gems by running:

    $ bundle install

Set up the database by running:

    $ rake db:setup

Launch the app server by running:

    $ rails server

Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) on your web browser.

Update the gems to their latest versions, if needed, by running:

    $ bundle update

### Running tests
To run tests, run the following command:  

    $ rake test

### Project History and Goals

This project was started in the Qualcomm EmpowHERment Hackathon. The goal during the hackathon was to create a web application that will be the Peace Corps app hub. The hub should have login access and also include access to all of our Peace Corps web and mobile app projects. It was specified that it must be implemented in an open source language in order to align with the open government initiative of the Peace Corps.

### Deliverables from the Hackathon

### After the Hackathon
PC Hub has been in the continuing works by independent contributors, as well as Open Source Day and Google Summer of Code. We invite you to contribute. You can submit a PR for your work against the “develop” branch on Systers PCHub GitHub repo.

PC Hub has been a project in Systers Google Summer of Code throughout the years. Please visit the GSoC wiki for each year so that you can see what the students have worked on. This will bring you up-to-date on the current state of the project.
